# Tracking-AI
Tracking AI is a java application designed to control remotely a robot, and makes it track certain shapes.

The current sources are under the form of a NetBeans project.

The application is supposed to be connected to a python script (running on a 'raspberry pi 2'). The python script is not in the source code, and probably should be, but we are lazy.

If you absolutely want to contribute, for some reason, this is what you can do:
Contact us. (Or alternatively, simply fork the repository witch would be much better)

Currently, the app is in a transitory state between plan 1.0 and plan 2.0, which makes it very unstable.
